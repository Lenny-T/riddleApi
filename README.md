Implemented an asynchronous fetch API protocol to dynamically retrieve randomized riddle data from the external resource endpoint https://riddles-api.vercel.app/random. Leveraging JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities, the application parses and renders riddle content onto the DOM, enhancing user interaction through a multi-layered UI experience. The interface features a 'Reveal Answer' button that triggers an event listener, seamlessly toggling the visibility of the riddleâ€™s answer without reloading the page. Additionally, a 'Refresh' button initiates a full-page reload, invoking a fresh API call to serve new riddle content. Aesthetic cohesion was maintained by integrating Google's 'Unbounded' font, ensuring a modern and visually appealing typographic design.
